# Krikey Senior Data Analyst Take Home Assignment
This repository has been created as a part of krikey's take home assingment. As per the suggestion by krikey team, my complete solution is consolidated and presented in 3 parts. The following table summarizes different parts/sections of this challenge.   

# Table of Contents
1. [Exploratory Data Analysis](#exploratory-data-analysis)
2. [Two Page Write Up](#two-page-write-up)
3. [Krikey App Data Projects](#krikey-app-data-projects)
4. [List of Tech Stack](#list-of-tech-stack)

# Part-1: Exploratory Data Analysis
First part of the challenge requires exploratory data analysis on the dataset provided. In this section, I first document my notes on different data sources that are provided under the sub-section [Data sources provided](#data-sources-provided). This is followed by a sub-section that provides link to the jupter notebook used for [exploratory data analysis](#link-to-eda-notebook).

## Data sources 
The dataset contains following tables:
1. **watchedVideo**: This contains all occurrences of the watchedVideo event.
2. **users**: This table contains the registered users
3. **videos**: This table contains all created videos
4. **feeds**: This contains the feeds the videos are served on

Entity Relationship Diagram of the Krikey challenge dataset is shown below:

## Link to EDA notebook
Jupyter Notebook that includes exploratory data analysis can be found [here](1_exploratory_data_analysis_krikey.ipynb)

# Part-2: Two Page Write up
Second part of the challenge requires a 2 page write up to present results to the executive team. In this section, we document selected outcomes from the exploratory data analysis that is completed in the previous section. This sub-section will serve like a middle-round to organize the data analysis results and get your thoughts organized before the write-up. The write up document is submitted as a google document file and can be accessed from [here](./2_krikey_write_up.docx).   

# Part-3: Krikey App Data Projects
In the final part of the challenge, I downloaded and explored the krikey app to provide a list of 3 analytics reports that would contribute to the app's overall growth and retention. Identified (3) reports are submitted in a one page document that can be accessed from [here](./3_app_reports.docx).


# List of Tech Stack
The tech stack that I used for this challenge are:
1. **Docker** 
2. **Jupyter Notebook** 
3. [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1COjb6MOlMUGJ0DfJt3_32kWOF8QGdp0OtM4sl1iOFeM/edit)

Use of above tech stack will assure work's:
- Reproducibility
- Local experiments
- Integration Test (CI/CD)
- Running data pipelines on the cloud (AWS Batch, Kubernetes jobs)
